The program decrypts the messaged by two different approaches and notes the time taken by each.</br>
It is clearly visible that the CRT approach algorith for decryption takes less time as compared to the Naive algorithm.

<br>Note: Sample output PNG attached</br>
<b>-------------------SAMPLE OUTPUT--------------------</b> </br>
Please input a number (plaintext) :3764</br>
The number after encryption is :</br>
7914</br>
The number after decryption is :</br>
3764</br>
The total time taken by 1st method is : 29.501000 s</br>
Using the 2nd method, the decrypted number is :</br>
3764</br>
The total time taken by 2nd method is : 0.184000 s</br>
